# 3.	Background
OF@TEIN: Toward an OpenFlow-enabled SDN (Software-Defined Networking) Infrastructure over TEIN is one of e-TEIN projects sponsored by Korean Government via NIA (National Information Agency), launched in July 2012. The project was led by Prof. JongWon Kim from NetCS (Networked Computing Systems) Laboratory, GIST (Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology) Korea. 

The main objective of OF@TEIN collaboration was to deploy a shared OpenFlow-based SDN testbed infrastructure among Korea, South-East Asia and South Asia collaborators over TEIN4. The collaborators from South-East Asia are HUST @Hanoi, Vietnam; ASTI @Manila, Philippines; Chulalongkorn University @Bangkok, Thailand; ITB @Bandung, Indonesia; University of Malaya @Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; MYREN NOC @Cyberjaya, Malaysia and from South Asia is PERN @Islamabad, Pakistan. In detail, a virtualized OpenFlow-enabled SDN testbed is built and operated over 7 International sites (Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia (2), Vietnam, Pakistan), and 5 sites in Korea (GIST @Gwangju; Korea U. @Seoul; KOREN-NOC@Seoul; Postech @Pohang; Jeju U. @Jeju). Mutual OF@TEIN collaboration MoUs (memo of understanding) between GIST and all partner institutes have been signed.

This project has completed successfully at the end of 2015. The completed SDN Testbed diagram of OF@TEIN infrastructure, built through the collaborative effort of OF@TEIN partners, is depicted below:
![proposal_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30137669/32212314-a923e04c-be59-11e7-80ba-1efdf62610c2.png)

In this project, a unique hyper-convergent SmartX Box (aka SmartX Rack) is designed and deployed in each site to promote the international SDN research collaboration over TEIN4 network infrastructure. There are five types (Type A/B/B+/B*/C) of unique SmartX Boxes being built for physical/virtual nodes for OpenFlow Switches, Capsulators, and VM (virtual machine) Workers. In 2014, all international sites have been upgraded to unified SmartX Boxes (Type B+) and the five Korean sites have been upgraded to SmartX Boxes (Type C) for OpenStack integration. As of May 2015, all SmartX Boxes (Type B+) have been upgraded to Type B*, which accommodates improved OpenStack-based Cloud support.

# 5.	Project Motivation and Goals
As presented in the project partners section, the partners of OF@TEIN+ can be divided into three different economy types.  Korea and Taiwan are from developed country, whereas from developing countries are India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. From least developed countries are Laos and Myanmar.  This is an important attempt in resource sharing and research collaboration across 3 different economy types. As such, the motivations of this project are as follow:

1.	Cloud enables economical & flexible shared cyber-infrastructure: Cloud represents the future paradigm of on-demand access to converged/virtualized (in terms of compute/networking/ storage) resources, shared data and information, and a usage-based billing model. Thus, based on cloud infrastructure/platform/software as a service, diverse services could be easily and economically realized in most academic, government and industry sectors.
2.	DevOps (Development & Operation) paradigm enables automated remote operation: The total cost of ownership will be significantly reduced due to the emergence of SDN/NFV/Cloud integration. This technology shift is the key driver to manage an appropriate-sized resource pool for cloud-leveraged infrastructure, which can suits the current and future computing/storage demands of TEIN community.
3.	Asi@Connect NRENs enjoy network-based sharing of high-cost computing/storage resources: Easy resource sharing among partners for both HPC (High Performance Computing) servers and large-capacity DataLake (file/object storages) will enhance ROI, research outcomes and outputs will increase in both quantity and quality.
4.	OF@TEIN collaboration can provide an excellent foundation for OF@TEIN+: The collaboration experience and human networking of OF@TEIN collaboration project (2012~2015) can provide an excellent foundation for this community-driven open collaboration effort.
5.	APAN Cloud WG can provide both technical supports and operation expertise: The new APAN Cloud WG (working group) and associated Cloud TF (task force) can provide technical expertise to build and operate a shared OF@TEIN+ SDN-Cloud and DataLake facility. 

With a strong collaborative experience of OF@TEIN partners working together, the following goals are put in place for OF@TEIN+ while addressing several targeted technical challenges:

1.	Gather and Learn Together: Expanding the OF@TEIN Community and Sharing the Knowledge about Open and Federated (i.e., shared) SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated Playground amongst the Members.
2.	Build and Upgrade Together: Deployment and Upgrade of Open/Federated Playground with Distributed SmartX Box Playground Resources and Centralized Data Lake/Analytics Hardware.
3.	Operate and Automate Together: Collaborate among Leading Members to enable Automated DevOps-style Operation of Playground Resources and Platforms.
4.	Play and Visualize Together: Collaborate with All Members in Experimenting (i.e., Playing) and Visualizing “Plays over Playground”.
5.	Investigate and Enrich Together: Investigate selected building-block topics on Future Network technology and attempt to enhance the playground capability/agility by applying the investigation outcomes.


# 6.	Program of Works and Timeline

This proposed project is meant for 22 months. The preliminary tasks are:

[Task #1 - Gather and Learn Together, M1-M22] Expanding the OF@TEIN Community and Sharing the Knowledge about Open and Federated (i.e., shared) SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated Playground amongst the Members.

1 – 1	[M1 – M22] Recruit new community members (up to 24 members) and encourage existing members to become active/leading members including selecting community ambassadors to spread (advertise and teach) the idea of playground-based open collaboration. Also prepare relevant online/offline training materials for all community members. 
1 – 2 	[M1 – M22] Organize collaboration community events including annual training workshops and meetings (possibly co-located with Asi@Connect/APAN community meetings) for exchanging the research idea and sharing the knowledge amongst the community members especially in how to build, operate, play, and investigate shared playground for research collaboration. 
1 – 3 	[M1 – M22] Coordinate project execution and support the handling of financial and administrative issues. Also facilitate community member mobility (e.g., exchange students/researchers, internship programs, and visiting scholars). 

[Task #2 - Build and Upgrade Together, M1-M22] Deployment and Upgrade of Open/Federated Playground with Distributed SmartX Box Playground Resources and Centralized Data Lake/Analytics Hardware.

2 – 1	[M1 – M22] Extend the deployment and upgrade of distributed SmartX Box playground resources in more diversified types (e.g., Type B/B+/B*/B**/B# and others to support SDN/NFV/Cloud integration) and at more member sites (up to 10 sites). This will enhance the proposed playground to suit for both typical SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated experimentations and advanced Future Network technology experimentations. Also help several problematic member sites (e.g., low-speed or isolated from R&E network) to access the playground through Access Center and Access Box.
2 – 2	[M13 – M22] Deploy and upgrade uniquely-designed Data Lake/Analytics hardware to enable the sharing of operation/experimentation visibility data and the BigData-based analysis on the shared data. It will be deployed at a member site in a beneficiary country (e.g., Malaysia Research Network Operation Center – MYREN NOC) and will be backed up by existing hardware in Korea (i.e., Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology - GIST).

[Task #3 - Operate and Automate Together, M1-M22] Collaborate among Leading Members to enable Automated DevOps-style Operation of Playground Resources and Platforms.

3 – 1	[M1 – M22] Establish the leading member coordination to jointly operate open/federated playground and cover various troubleshooting/support interactions with both underlying network infrastructure administrators (i.e., NREN/TEIN NOCs) and experimentation players.
3 – 2	[M7 – M22] Convert existing playground operation experience into DevOps-style automated operation by jointly designing and developing platform and tools for playground operation (e.g., provisioning/visibility/orchestration).

 ![proposal_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30137669/32212418-fec4f216-be59-11e7-8d86-30a347bac2e0.png)

[Task #4 – Play and Visualize Together, M1-M22] Collaborate with All Members in Experimenting (i.e., Playing) and Visualizing “Plays over Playground”.
