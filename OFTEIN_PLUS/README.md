# Executive Summary


1. Gather and Learn Together: Expanding the OF@TEIN Community and Sharing the Knowledge about Open and Federated (i.e., shared) SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated Playground amongst the Members.
2. Build and Upgrade Together: Deployment and Upgrade of Open/Federated Playground with Distributed SmartX Box Playground Resources and Centralized Data Lake/Analytics Hardware.
3. Operate and Automate Together: Collaborate among Leading Members to enable Automated DevOps-style Operation of Playground Resources and Platforms.
4. Play and Visualize Together: Collaborate with All Members in Experimenting (i.e., Playing) and Visualizing “Plays over Playground”.
5. Investigate and Enrich Together: Investigate selected building-block topics on Future Network technology and attempt to enhance the playground capability/agility by applying the investigation outcomes.

OF@TEIN: Toward an OpenFlow-enabled SDN (Software-Defined Networking) Infrastructure over TEIN – was one of e-TEIN projects sponsored by Korean Government via NIA (National Information Agency), launched in July 2012 and led by Prof. JongWon Kim from NetCS (Networked Computing Systems) Laboratory, GIST (Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology), Korea. This project has completed successfully with many success stories have been achieved by the collaborators.  For example, 
a)	An overlay virtualized OpenFlow-enabled SDN testbed over 12 international sites; 
b)	Open and wide availability of state-of-the-art distributed SDN-Cloud testbed facility; 
c)	Co-authored publications in high impact journals and conference proceedings; 
d)	Dedicated knowledge-sharing workshops conducted annually in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam; 
e)	Students and professors’ mobility between collaborators; 
f)	Incubated joint researches among project partners to work closely and improve research quality and impact; 
g)	Contributed to the creation of APAN Cloud WG (and to-be-established Cloud TF) to promote the cloud-based computing/storage sharing among TEIN community.

As OF@TEIN project has completed with many success stories, “OF@TEIN+: Open/Federated Playgrounds for Future Networks” is proposed to further enhance, extend and expand OF@TEIN. The main purpose of OF@TEIN+ is to build and operate an Open and Federated Future Internet (SDN/ NFV/Cloud-integrated) Testbed in further promoting SDN-Cloud R&D collaboration among TEIN partners.

In order to bring OF@TEIN+ to a greater height, a project team with members from every collaboration country has been formed.  The project team (to be expanded to include more Asi@Connect connected countries) is as follow:

TEAM MEMBERS: 

Aung Htein Maw, PhD (UCSY, Myanmar)
Bayani Benjamin Lara (ASTI, Philippines)
Bo Shik Shin (KOREN-NOC, Korea) 
Chaodit Aswakul, PhD (Chulalongkorn University, Thailand)
Chu-Sing Yang, PhD (National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan)
Chun-Yong Chong (Monash Malaysia, Malaysia) 
Đinh Văn Dũng, PhD (VNU, Vietnam)
Eueung Mulyana, PhD (ITB, Indonesia) 
Jiann-Liang Chen, PhD (NTUST, Taiwan)
Khamxay Leevangtou (NUOL, Laos)
Li-Der Chou, PhD (NCU, Taiwan)
Muhammad Tayyab Chaudhry, PhD (CIIT, Lahore, Pakistan)
Nguyen Huu Thanh, PhD (HUST, Vietnam)
Panjai Tantatsanawong, PhD (UNINET, Thailand)
Paventhan Arumugam, PhD (ERNET, India)
Philip Ho (HKU, HK)
Su Thawda Win, PhD (UCSM, Myanmar)
Sunyoung Han, PhD (Konkuk U, Korea)
Te-Lung Liu, PhD (NCHC, Taiwan)
Wangcheol Song, PhD (Jeju University, Korea)


The project team will ensure the aims and goals of OF@TEIN+ are achieved according to current best practices. 
At the end of the project (22 months), the below goals will be achieved:
